As a final assignment for this course we created this App using the knowledge that we acquired on the last 4 weeks.
We used the `create-react-app` command-line. This made our way easier, because we didnt have to search for the dependencies or decide wich script to use.

All the logic is inside the `Container component`. This logic and the state is accessed by all of his child components through JavaScript functions and props written in ECMAScript 6.

We tried to respect DRY and KISS principles.

The App consumes asynchronously an API (in this case we consume GitHub Job's API) and when it get the answer formats the data to show them how we decided.

This API receives the request, process the data and then send us a response with the results of the search. The paramas can be null.

We used trello to organize the assigment. [Link to Trello](https://trello.com/b/syjjZRm6/github-jobs)

Thanks you for the time and for letting us participate in this BootCamp.
